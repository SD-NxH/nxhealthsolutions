      <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Dragon fruit, or pitaya, is a fruit with a vibrant appearance and a wealth of potential health benefits. It is rich in <u>antioxidants</u>, particularly vitamin C and betalains, which shield the body's cells from damage caused by free radicals, thereby reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Additionally, the fruit is high in dietary fiber, promoting digestive health by preventing constipation and nourishing a balanced gut microbiome.
